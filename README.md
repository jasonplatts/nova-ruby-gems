## Configuration

The Ruby Gems extension will search for a 'Gemfile' in the root directory of the project unless a 'Gemfile' location is specified in the workspace preferences.

### Workspace Configuration
To specify a 'Gemfile' location, go to the workspace preferences, select Ruby Gems, and choose a file. Simply delete the path if you wish to for the extension to automatically find and include the default 'Gemfile' from the root directory again.
